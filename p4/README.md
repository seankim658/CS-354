**p4: Cache Simulator**  
  
Goals:  
1. First part's purpose is to understand more about how caches work and learn a bit about simulation.  
2. Second part's purpose is to work to make a small cache simulator.  
  
Use a dynamic binary instrumentation framework called pin to measure cache performance statistics of an executable program by specifying certain cache parameters.
